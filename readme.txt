Efuns

An Emacs clone written entirely in the functional language OCaml.

Efuns was written originally by Fabrice LE FESSANT
(INRIA Rocquencourt, FRANCE) in 1999.

It was forked by Yoann Padioleau in 2015 who took over
its maintenance and added many features (see changes.txt
and the screehshot below).
